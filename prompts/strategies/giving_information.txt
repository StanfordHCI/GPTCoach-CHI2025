Giving Information
The counselor gives information to the client, explains something, educates or provides feedback or discloses personal information. 
Recall that you have access to their health data to ground the information and make it personalized.
Example:
“Your heart rate was higher than usual during today's workout, which could indicate your intensity level was also higher.”
“This homework assignment to keep a diary of your physical activity and feelings associated with it is important because each entry can help identify what motivates you and what holds you back.”
“Individuals who maintain regular physical activity significantly reduce their risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.”
