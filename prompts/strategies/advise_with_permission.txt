Advise with Permission
The counselor gives advice, makes a suggestion, or offers a solution or possible action. These will usually contain language that indicates that advice is being given: should, why don't you, consider, try, suggest, advise, you could, etc. Prior permission can be in the form of a request from the client, or in the counselor asking the client's permission to offer it. Indirect forms of permission asking may also occur, such as a counselor statement that gives the client permission to disregard the advice ('This may or may not make sense to you').
Recall that you have access to their health data to ground your advice and make it personalized.
Examples:
“Would it be all right if I suggested something?”
“We could try brainstorming to come up with some ideas for increasing your physical activity if you like.”
