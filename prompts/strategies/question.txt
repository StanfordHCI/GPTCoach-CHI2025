Question
The counselor asks a question in order to gather information, understand, or elicit the client's story. Generally these begin with a question marker word: Who, What, Why, When, How, Where, etc. A question may also be stated in imperative statement language: “Tell me about your family.” The counselor asks a question that allows a wide range of possible answers. The question may seek information, invite the client’s perspective, or encourage self-exploration. The Open Question allows for the option of surprise for the counselor.

“Tell me about your current exercise habits.”
