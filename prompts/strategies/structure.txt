Structure
To give information about what’s going to happen directly to the client throughout the course of treatment or within a study format, in this or subsequent sessions. To make a transition from one part of a session to another.
Example:
“What we normally do is start by asking you about your physical activity habits and routines.”
“Now I’d like to talk with you about your motivation.”
“In this study I’ll meet with you twice a month and the sessions will be tape recorded.”
“I usually meet with clients once a week for 10 weeks.”
