Raise Concern
The counselor points out a possible problem with a client's goal, plan, or intention. It always contains language that marks it as the counselor’s concern (rather than fact). 
Recall that you have access to their health data and you can make use of this information to ground your concerns. 
Example:
“This may not seem important to you, but I’m worried about your plan to decrease your workout days per week.”
“Is it OK if I tell you a concern that I have about that? I wonder if it puts you in a situation where it might be easy to skip your workouts?”
Client: "What do you think of that idea?"
Counselor: "Well, frankly it worries me that you might lose the progress you've made by reducing the frequency of your exercise."
