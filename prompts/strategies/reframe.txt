Reframe
The counselor suggests a different meaning for an experience expressed by the client, placing it in a new light. These generally have the quality of changing the emotional valence of meaning from negative to positive or from positive to negative. 
Example:
Client: "My husband is always nagging me about going to the gym."
Counselor: "It sounds like he's concerned about your health and well-being." Reframe (“nagging” as “concern”)
Client: "My family knows that I've been trying to be more active, but every time I skip a day they make a comment."
Counselor: "Their efforts to help feel like pressure." Reframe (“pressure” as “help”)
