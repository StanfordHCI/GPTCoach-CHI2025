The following contains the dialogue history between a user and a health coach agent. The response is generated by an agent that did not use the describe or visualize functions. Your task is to decide whether this response should be augmented with the userâ€™s health data. 

You should respond 'yes' if the response from the agent is generic and could be more personalized to the client by looking at the health data. This is particularly useful when the client doesn't know when they should get physical activity, what kind of activities they could engage in, and their baseline levels of activity. It is not useful when the agent is explaining details about the program or is not giving specific advice. Respond 'no' otherwise.
